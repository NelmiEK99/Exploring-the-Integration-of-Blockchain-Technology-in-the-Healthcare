# Exploring-the-Integration-of-Blockchain-Technology-in-the-Healthcare
Blockchain has emerged as a disruptive technology that has revolutionized the field of cryptocurrencies. With its successful implementation in this domain, opportunities exist to assess the feasibility of applying blockchain technology in various industry sectors such as supply chain management, law, and real estate. The application of blockchain technology in the healthcare sector could unlock numerous opportunities to securely store patient data in a tamper-resistant manner. Additionally, it enables data to be stored in a decentralized manner without relying on a central governing authority. Blockchain could also address current limitations in data storage, mitigate patient data privacy concerns, and prevent attacks from malicious actors. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel approach to securely storing patient data using blockchain technology. A novel algorithm, named the Cross-Hash Validator Algorithm, has been implemented at the core of the blockchain model to further enhance data security and minimize redundancies. Furthermore, the proposed blockchain platform facilitates a streamlined process for patient data consent management and enables the provision of medical records in an anonymous manner for business analytical purposes.
